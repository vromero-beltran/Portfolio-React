          My name is Victor. With a controller in one hand and hiking boots on
          my feet, I embrace adventures and variety in life. I am as likely to
          spend an afternoon questing through vitrual worlds as I am blazing
          trails in the wilderness, I find joy in both indoor and outdoor
          pursuits. Whether gathering friends around a table for an immersive
          board game or firing up the grill for a backyard barbecue, I value
          quality time with loved ones.

          My passion for coding is matched only by my passion for the Marine
          Corps. I am a trained marine veteran with a passion for coding and a
          love of the outdoors. After serving my country, I embarked on a new
          adventure - traversing the states with my wonderful girlfriend as she
          works as a travel nurse. I fill my days learning new skills in full
          stack development, hiking local trails, playing board games with
          friends, and doting on my two dogs. I am driven by curiosity and
          determination to constantly better myself while finding joy in
          life&apos;s simple pleasures.
